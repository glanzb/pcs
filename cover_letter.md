Dear Cris,
 
As the Managing Director (and part owner) of the Hungarian InforMed 2002 Kft, running the [**InforMed**](www.informed.hu) Medical portal since 2002, I earned experience in various fields of operation, starting at an administrative level and becoming an editor and project manager at the company. In addition to the project management I have considerable understanding of web design, databases, mobile applications, marketing and social networking. I feel comfortable working in teams as well as leading projects individually.

Now that my children both are in school, I will return to full time work, and I would like to take a turn in my carrier before I enter the Portland job market. As a graduate of the Moholy-Nagy University of Arts and Design Budapest, Hungary (visual communication) and managing director/project manager of the Hungarian medical portal InforMed.hu I decided to go back to school and learn more about web design and programming.
 
I reviewed the classes of the Portland Code School and I believe the Front End Development class is a good fit for my interest and recent skills. I enjoy working on complex projects and I consider challenges an opportunity to learn and discover new areas.
 
At my present job I have a reputation for being hard working and precise, getting all projects done on time and within budget.
 
For me it would exciting and challenging to become a student of the Portland Code School.
 
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.
 
Regards,

Brigitta Glanz
